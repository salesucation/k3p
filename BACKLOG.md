# Backlog
## for 3 1 week sprints Christmas Holidays 2024/2025

1. as a founder I need to install a CRM on salesucation.com so that I can follow up with potential customers
2. as a devops engineer I need to install signoz on salesucation.com so that I can effectively support the installation script as well as microservices and other parts of my serverless eco system
3. as a user of serverless I need a bash script that bootstraps python and open telemetry so that I can install salesucation on my server, AKS, EKS or GKS cluster
4. as a founder I need a microservice that sends an email, creates a contact in the CRM and prompts for a code, sent in the email so that I can follow up with potential customers
5. as a devops engineer I need the python script to consumes the microservice and sends headers through otel so that I can have a distributed trace if there is an issue
6. as a user of serverless I need the installation to detect the kubernetes environment from "bare metal", GKS, AKS or EKS and install knative so that I don't experience lockin and can continue using my current cloud provider
7. as a user of serverless I need a git http server so that I can have continuous build and deployment everytime I push my changes
8. as a user of serverless I need s3 compatible storage so that my initial page load is fast enough to get a good lighthouse score and not turn people away from my web presence

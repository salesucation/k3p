## ... learning with customers for sales engineers

More to come, but this repository is for an sdk that makes a wordpress, flask or laravel site serverless. It is also a central place to share [issues or friction](https://github.com/salesucation/salesucation/issues) that you are having with the development environment at [https://salesucation.com](https://salesucation.com).

There is also a [discussion](https://github.com/salesucation/salesucation/discussions) feature here for sharing anything else of interest to sales engineers working on completing a business to business product by learning with customers.

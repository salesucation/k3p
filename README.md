## serverless ecosystem for when servers are too expensive or unavailable because of a business interuption

This is an open source way to deploy a serverless app, microservice or microfrontend. It uses knative and a git repository to build and deploy your source code, like heroku or openshift 1 used to. It is also a central place to share [issues or friction](https://github.com/salesucation/salesucation/issues) that you are having with the hosted deployment environment at [https://salesucation.com](https://salesucation.com). Please go to [https://salesucation.com](https://salesucation.com) to see how serverless can save your web presence when your current solution is too expensive or faces business interruption.

There is also a [discussion](https://github.com/salesucation/salesucation/discussions) feature here for sharing anything of interest to people faced with an expensive, unsupported or just broken web presence.

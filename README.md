## ... diy self service portals by sales engineers

More to come, but this repository is for an sdk that makes a wordpress or flask site serverless. It is also a central place to share [issues or friction](https://github.com/salesucation/salesucation/issues) that you are having with the development environment at [https://salesucation.com](https://salesucation.com). Please go to [https://salesucation.com](https://salesucation.com) to see why serverless might be a good thing for sales engineers to know about.

There is also a [discussion](https://github.com/salesucation/salesucation/discussions) feature here for sharing anything else of interest to sales engineers working on completing a self service portal by learning with customers.
